    "\n",
    "159. What are unit tests in Python?\n",
    "Unit test is a unit testing framework of Python.\n",
    "Unit testing means testing different components of software separately. Can you think about why unit testing is important? Imagine a scenario, you are building software that uses three components namely A, B, and C. Now, suppose your software breaks at a point time. How will you find which component was responsible for breaking the software? Maybe it was component A that failed, which in turn failed component B, and this actually failed the software. There can be many such combinations.\n",
    "This is why it is necessary to test each and every component properly so that we know which component might be highly responsible for the failure of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "160. What is break, continue and pass in Python?\n",
    "Break\tThe break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.\n",
    "Continue\tThe continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "Pass\tAs explained above, the pass keyword in Python is generally used to fill up empty blocks and is similar to an empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java, C++, Javascript, etc.\n",

    "Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword. But unlike in C++, self is not a keyword in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "162. What are global, protected and private attributes in Python?\n",
    "Global variables are public variables that are defined in the global scope. To use the variable in the global scope inside a function, we use the global keyword.\n",
    "Protected attributes are attributes defined with an underscore prefixed to their identifier eg. _sara. They can still be accessed and modified from outside the class they are defined in but a responsible developer should refrain from doing so.\n",
    "Private attributes are attributes with double underscore prefixed to their identifier eg. __ansh. They cannot be accessed or modified from the outside directly and will result in an AttributeError if such an attempt is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "163. What are modules and packages in Python?\n",
    "Python packages and Python modules are two mechanisms that allow for modular programming in Python. Modularizing has several advantages -\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Working on a single module helps you focus on a relatively small portion of the problem at hand. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "Maintainability: Modules are designed to enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If they are written in a manner that reduces interdependency, it is less likely that modifications in a module might impact other parts of the program.\n",
    "Reusability: Functions defined in a module can be easily reused by other parts of the application.\n",
    "Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid confusion between identifiers from other parts of the program.\n",
    "Modules, in general, are simply Python files with a .py extension and can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented. They can be imported and initialized once using the import statement. If partial functionality is needed, import the requisite classes or functions using from foo import bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names.\n",
    "Creating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just stuff the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can technically import the package as well, but alas, it doesn't import the modules within the package to the local namespace, thus, it is practically useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "164. What is pass in Python?\n",
    "The pass keyword represents a null operation in Python. It is generally used for the purpose of filling up empty blocks of code which may execute during runtime but has yet to be written. Without the pass statement in the following code, we may run into some errors during code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "def myEmptyFunc():\n",

    "# IndentationError: expected an indented block\n",
    "\n",
    "165. What are the common built-in data types in Python?\n",
    "There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides type() and isinstance() functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories-\n",
    "\n",
    "None Type:\n",
    "None keyword represents the null values in Python. Boolean equality operation can be performed using these NoneType objects.\n",
    "Class Name\tDescription\n",
    "NoneType\tRepresents the NULL values in Python.\n",
    "Numeric Types:\n",
    "There are three distinct numeric types - integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Additionally, booleans are a sub-type of integers.\n",
    "Class Name\tDescription\n",
    "int\tStores integer literals including hex, octal and binary numbers as integers\n",
    "float\tStores literals containing decimal values and/or exponent signs as floating-point numbers\n",
    "complex\tStores complex numbers in the form (A + Bj) and has attributes: real and imag\n",
    "bool\tStores boolean value (True or False).\n",
    "Note: The standard library also includes fractions to store rational numbers and decimal to store floating-point numbers with user-defined precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence Types:\n",
    "According to Python Docs, there are three basic Sequence Types - lists, tuples, and range objects. Sequence types have the in and not in operators defined for their traversing their elements. These operators share the same priority as the comparison operations.\n",
    "Class Name\tDescription\n",
    "list\tMutable sequence used to store collection of items.\n",
    "tuple\tImmutable sequence used to store collection of items.\n",
    "range\tRepresents an immutable sequence of numbers generated during execution.\n",
    "str\tImmutable sequence of Unicode code points to store textual data.\n",
    "Note: The standard library also includes additional types for processing:\n",
    "1. Binary data such as bytearray bytes memoryview , and\n",
    "2. Text strings such as str.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping Types:\n",
    "A mapping object can map hashable values to random objects in Python. Mappings objects are mutable and there is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Name \tDescription\n",
    "dict\tStores comma-separated list of key: value pairs\n",
    "Set Types:\n",
    "Currently, Python has two built-in set types - set and frozenset. set type is mutable and supports methods like add() and remove(). frozenset type is immutable and can't be modified after creation.\n",
    "Class Name\tDescription\n",
    "set\tMutable unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.\n",
    "frozenset\tImmutable collection of distinct hashable objects.\n",
    "Note: set is mutable and thus cannot be used as key for a dictionary. On the other hand, frozenset is immutable and thus, hashable, and can be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules:\n",
    "Module is an additional built-in type supported by the Python Interpreter. It supports one special operation, i.e., attribute access: mymod.myobj, where mymod is a module and myobj references a name defined in m's symbol table. The module's symbol table resides in a very special attribute of the module __dict__, but direct assignment to this module is neither possible nor recommended.\n",
    "Callable Types:\n",
    "Callable types are the types to which function call can be applied. They can be user-defined functions, instance methods, generator functions, and some other built-in functions, methods and classes.\n",
    "Refer to the documentation at docs.python.org for a detailed view of the callable types\n",
    "\n",
    "168. What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?\n",
    "Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97).\n",
    "But what is the real difference between the two? The key difference between the two is that while lists are mutable, tuples on the other hand are immutable objects. This means that lists can be modified, appended or sliced on the go but tuples remain constant and cannot be modified in any manner. You can run the following example on Python IDLE to confirm the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = ('sara', 6, 5, 0.97)\n",
    "my_list = ['sara', 6, 5, 0. 97]\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])     # output => 'sara'\n",
    "print(my_list[0])     # output => 'sara'\n",
    "my_tuple[0] = 'ansh'    # modifying tuple => throws an error\n",
    "my_list[0] = 'ansh'    # modifying list => list modified\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])     # output => 'sara'\n",
    "print(my_list[0])     # output => 'ansh'\n",
    "14. What is Scope in Python?\n",
    "Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects without any prefix. A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A local scope refers to the local objects available in the current function.\n",
    "A global scope refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception.\n",
    "A module-level scope refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program.\n",
    "An outermost scope refers to all the built-in names callable in the program. The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced.\n",
    "Note: Local scope objects can be synced with global scope objects using keywords such as global.\n",
    "\n",
    "169. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?\n",
    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "170. What is an Interpreted language?\n",
    "An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "171. What is a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, \"1\" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for \"type-coercion\" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output \"12\" as result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-checking can be done at two stages -\n",
    "\n",
    "Static - Data Types are checked before execution.\n",
    "Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution.\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "172. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "173.Benefits of using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.\n",
    "Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "174. What are Dict and List comprehensions?\n",
    "Python comprehensions, like decorators, are syntactic sugar constructs that help build altered and filtered lists, dictionaries, or sets from a given list, dictionary, or set. Using comprehensions saves a lot of time and code that might be considerably more verbose (containing more lines of code). Let's check out some examples, where comprehensions can be truly beneficial:\n",

    "\n",
    "175. What are decorators in Python?\n",
    "Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. They are represented the @decorator_name in Python and are called in a bottom-up fashion. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# decorator function to convert to lowercase\n",
    "def lowercase_decorator(function):\n",
    "   def wrapper():\n",
    "       func = function()\n",

    "def hello():\n",
    "   return 'Hello World'\n",
    "hello()   # output => [ 'hello' , 'world' ]\n",
    "The beauty of the decorators lies in the fact that besides adding functionality to the output of the method, they can even accept arguments for functions and can further modify those arguments before passing it to the function itself. The inner nested function, i.e. 'wrapper' function, plays a significant role here. It is implemented to enforce encapsulation and thus, keep itself hidden from the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "# decorator function to capitalize names\n",
    "def names_decorator(function):\n",
    "   def wrapper(arg1, arg2):\n",

    "176. What is Scope Resolution in Python?\n",
    "Sometimes objects within the same scope have the same name but function differently. In such cases, scope resolution comes into play in Python automatically. A few examples of such behavior are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules namely 'math' and 'cmath' have a lot of functions that are common to both of them - log10(), acos(), exp() etc. To resolve this ambiguity, it is necessary to prefix them with their respective module, like math.exp() and cmath.exp().\n",
    "Consider the code below, an object temp has been initialized to 10 globally and then to 20 on function call. However, the function call didn't change the value of the temp globally. Here, we can observe that Python draws a clear line between global and local variables, treating their namespaces as separate identities.\n",
    "temp = 10   # global-scope variable\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "     temp = 20   # local-scope variable\n",

    "print(temp)   # output => 10\n",
    "func()    # output => 20\n",
    "print(temp)   # output => 10\n",
    "This behavior can be overridden using the global keyword inside the function, as shown in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "temp = 10   # global-scope variable\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "     global temp\n",

    "print(temp)   # output => 20\n",
    "\n",
    "178. What are Python namespaces? Why are they used?\n",
    "A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Namespace includes local names inside a function. the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.\n",
    "Global Namespace includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.\n",
    "Built-in Namespace includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for various types of exceptions.\n",
    "The lifecycle of a namespace depends upon the scope of objects they are mapped to. If the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace comes to an end. Hence, it isn't possible to access inner namespace objects from an outer namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    ".py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your program. We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (source code). .pyc files are not created for all the files that you run. It is only created for the files that you import.\n",
    "Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled files. If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. If not found, it checks for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file and then python virtual machine executes it.\n",

    "193. What is pickling and unpickling?\n",
    "Python library offers a feature - serialization out of the box. Serializing an object refers to transforming it into a format that can be stored, so as to be able to deserialize it, later on, to obtain the original object. Here, the pickle module comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling is the name of the serialization process in Python. Any object in Python can be serialized into a byte stream and dumped as a file in the memory. The process of pickling is compact but pickle objects can be compressed further. Moreover, pickle keeps track of the objects it has serialized and the serialization is portable across versions.\n",
    "The function used for the above process is pickle.dump().\n",
    "Unpickling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpickling is the complete inverse of pickling. It deserializes the byte stream to recreate the objects stored in the file and loads the object to memory.\n",
    "The function used for the above process is pickle.load().\n",
    "Note: Python has another, more primitive, serialization module called marshall, which exists primarily to support .pyc files in Python and differs significantly from the pickle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "194. What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?\n",
    "xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a sequence of integers, with the only difference that range() returns a Python list, whereas, xrange() returns an xrange object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does that make a difference? It sure does, because unlike range(), xrange() doesn't generate a static list, it creates the value on the go. This technique is commonly used with an object-type generator and has been termed as \"yielding\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Yielding is crucial in applications where memory is a constraint. Creating a static list as in range() can lead to a Memory Error in such conditions, while, xrange() can handle it optimally by using just enough memory for the generator (significantly less in comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in xrange(10):    # numbers from o to 9\n",
    "   print i       # output => 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n",

    "for i in xrange(1, 10, 2):    # skip by two for next\n",
    "   print i       # output => 1 3 5 7 9\n",
    "Note: xrange has been deprecated as of Python 3.x. Now range does exactly the same as what xrange used to do in Python 2.x, since it was way better to use xrange() than the original range() function in Python 2.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "195. How do you copy an object in Python?\n",
    "In Python, the assignment statement (= operator) does not copy objects. Instead, it creates a binding between the existing object and the target variable name. To create copies of an object in Python, we need to use the copy module. Moreover, there are two ways of creating copies for the given object using the copy module -\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow Copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. The copied object created has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If either of the values is a reference to other objects, just the reference addresses for the same are copied.\n",
    "Deep Copy copies all values recursively from source to target object, i.e. it even duplicates the objects referenced by the source object.\n",

    "\n",
    "196. How will you check if a class is a child of another class?\n",
    "This is done by using a method called issubclass() provided by python. The method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning true or false accordingly.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(object):\n",
    "   pass   \n",

    "\n",
    "197. What is init method in python?\n",
    "The init method works similarly to the constructors in Java. The method is run as soon as an object is instantiated. It is useful for initializing any attributes or default behaviour of the object at the time of instantiation.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class InterviewbitEmployee:\n",
    "\n",
    "   # init method / constructor\n",

    "emp = InterviewbitEmployee('Mr Employee')    # __init__ method is called here and initializes the object name with \"Mr Employee\"\n",
    "emp.introduce()\n",
    "198. Why is finalize used?\n",
    "Finalize method is used for freeing up the unmanaged resources and clean up before the garbage collection method is invoked. This helps in performing memory management tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "199. Differentiate between new and override modifiers.\n",
    "The new modifier is used to instruct the compiler to use the new implementation and not the base class function. The Override modifier is useful for overriding a base class function inside the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "200. How is an empty class created in python?\n",
    "An empty class does not have any members defined in it. It is created by using the pass keyword (the pass command does nothing in python). We can create objects for this class outside the class.\n",
    "For example-\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmptyClassDemo:\n",
    "   pass\n",
    "obj=EmptyClassDemo()\n",

    "Yes, it is possible if the base class is instantiated by other child classes or if the base class is a static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Are access specifiers used in python?\n",
    "Python does not make use of access specifiers specifically like private, public, protected, etc. However, it does not derive this from any variables. It has the concept of imitating the behaviour of variables by making use of a single (protected) or double underscore (private) as prefixed to the variable names. By default, the variables without prefixed underscores are public.\n",
